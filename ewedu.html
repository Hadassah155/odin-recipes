    <p>Ewedu soup is a delicacy in Nigeria. Apart from being delicious and nutritious, it is very simple to make. The soup is usually served with beans stew together with beef stew, or fish stew and can be a mouth-watering accompaniment to many solid meals like pounded yam and fufu.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients for making Ewedu</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> Fresh or frozen jute leaves -Ewedu leaves can be bought fresh from a local market or frozen at your local African/Caribbean and parsian/indian stores.</li>
         <li>Water - This only applies for frsh ewedu leaves. You will not need water if you buy the frozen pack. It comes with enough water in each pack.</li>
          <li>Locust bean - I love adding locust bean to my ewedu soup. It gives the soup a very rich, deep flavor. However, you may skip this if you are new to it because it has a pungent smell in it’s raw form. I also blend this insto the ewedu eaves for my kids so they don’t see the ”beans” and pick them out.</li>
          <li>Crayfish gives ewedu its rich taste and smell</li>
         <li>Salt and bouillon powder (cube) - A little goes a long way in improving the taste of your ewedu.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps to make Ewedu Soup</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>All you need to do is to pluck the jute leaves one at a time. </li>
         <li> Rinse and drain off the water, If the leaves have some sand in them, it is advisable to just use your hand to pack the jute leaves from the water so that the settled sand and stones will be left behind.</li>
         <li>Place the clean jute leaves inside a pot of hot boiling water and cook for about 8 to 10 minutes or till the jute leaves become tender. At this point stir in the crayfish, Locust bean, salt, and stock cube.</li>
         <li>My mom will always use the small traditional broom called ijabe to blend the ewedu until it becomes smooth. However, a blender will do this just fine. Just pour the boiled leaves inside your blender and blend till smooth. This will take a few seconds to a minute so be sure to keep an eye on it.</li>
         <li>You can serve with your favorite swallow like Eba, Pounded yam or fufu.</li>
