    <h1>SUYA</h1>
    <img src="https://www.willflyforfood.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/suya.jpg.webp"alt=Hausa delicacy>
     <p>suya (or tsire) refers to a skewered spicy meat dish popular in Nigeria and in other parts of West Africa. It’s made with skewered grilled meats like beef, chicken, ram, and offal marinated in a complex mixture of spices called yaji.
        Suya is native to the Hausa people of northern Nigeria but it's now widely consumed throughout the country. It’s commonly sold as street food and eaten at restaurants with a side of fresh cabbage, tomatoes, and onions.</p>
        
    <h2>Ingredients for making suya</h2>
       <ul>
            <li>Beef: My favorites are flank steak, skirt steak, sirloin, and topside</li>
             <li>Yaji spice: A delicious blend of peanut-based spice. I have a simple recipe for it here.</li>
             <li>Oil - Peanut oil is preferred but not mandatory. You can use any other oil of your choice</li>
             <li>Others: Salt, bouillon, cayenne pepper</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>How to Make Beef Suya</h2>
        <ol>
             <li>Before you start, be sure to soak your skewers in water for at least 30 minutes. If you plan to grill outdoors, it's best to soak overnight.</li>
             <li>The preparation of suya always begins with the meat. Be sure to slice the meat as thinly as you can. I always tell my butcher to do that for me. Then I cut it into small pieces before marinating it.</li> 
             <li>Also, depending on the cut of meat I choose, I sometimes tenderize before cooking, so make the meat a little tender.</li>
             <li>Next, I season the beef with salt, bouillon, and a bit of cayenne pepper. Add the oil and mix well, then cover and leave in the refrigerator to marinate for at least one hour. You can as well leave overnight. This will allow for better flavor absorption.</li>
             Note: Cayenne pepper is optional. If you don't like spicy food or if your yaji spice is spicy, you can skip it.</li>
              <li>Thread the meat onto skewers, about 4 to 5 pieces on each skewer, making sure that each piece of meat is touching the other pieces (this will help keep them from drying out).</li>
             <li>Put the yaji spice ( a little at a time) in a pan or bowl big enough to accommodate the skewered beef, then place the meat on the plate to coat the two sides with the spice.</li>
             <li>Once all the skewered meat are well coated, arrange them on a wire rack placed over a large tray and roast in the oven.</li>
             </ol>
